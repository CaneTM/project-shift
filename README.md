## Game Ideas:

* Recreate Adventure (Atari):
  * Have an actual player instead of a square (e.g. a knight or imperial soldier)
  * Add a storyline
  * Add enemies
  * Maybe replace the chalice with another object?
  * More places to visit (e.g. different cities, different castles, etc)
  * Add NPCs
  
* Fighting game

* A graphical representation of a text adventure
